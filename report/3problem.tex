\section{Problem Definition and Data Description}
We obtained the data used by \cite{yang2017attention}. The data consists of a collection of tweets as well as some network information on Twitter. For each tweet sample, we have one tweet ID, one user ID, a sentiment label (positive, neutral, negative), and the tweet content itself. For example, the following are two examples of our data samples.
\begin{verbatim}
261140278944088066	17572408	negative	@USER may i have an industrial revolution ...
237571817550786563	727519172	neutral	@USER i told you shane would get his 5th-star ...
\end{verbatim}
We have three networks, i.e., FOLLOWER, MENTION and RETWEET network which have been explained in details by
\cite{yang2017attention}.
